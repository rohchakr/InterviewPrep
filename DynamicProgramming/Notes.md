1. Space complexity depends on the size of call stack used - for trees dfs - height of the tree
2. Complexity of fibonacci - sandwitch - (n-1)(n-1) >= (n-1)(n-2) >= (n-2)(n-2)
3. Dynamic Programming - Overlapping subproblems
4. private Map<Integer, Integer> n = m; is different than private Map<Integer, Integer> o = new HashMap<>(m);
5. Grid traveller - memoize, flip and again memoize
6. Store hashmap keys as strings for complex key types
